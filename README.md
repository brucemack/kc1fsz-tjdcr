Overview
========

This is a compact PCB implementation of the famous Thomas Jefferson Direct Conversion Receiver
designed by Bill Meara (N2CQR) and Dean Souleles (KK4DAS). Full documentation for the 
original rig [can be found here](https://hackaday.io/project/190327-high-schoolers-build-a-radio-receiver). This project has been discussed at length
on the excellent Solder Smoke Podcast and in a detailed series of videos can be found
[starting here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLjxU2rMeXw). I would particularly 
encourage you to watch Dean's tutorial series on YouTube.

I built this rig as part of the "Direct Conversion Challenge" issued by Bill and Dean. As
stipulated by Bill/Dean, I am resisting all temptations to modify/improve the original 
circuit. This is a completely *pure* TJ-DCR, but using modern construction techniques 
including a commercial PCB, SMD components (mostly 0805), and the most compact layout
I could come up with.

Once the testing is complete I will make the PCB/BOM available for anyone who wants
to test it.

I am using KiCAD V8 for the schematic capture and PCB layout.
